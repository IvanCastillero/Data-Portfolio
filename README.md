# Data Science and Analytics proyects

Hello, my name is Ivan and I am a junior data analyst. I have always been fascinated by the power of data to inform decision-making, drive innovation, and solve complex problems. Over the past few years, I have pursued my passion for data analytics by completing several courses, including the Google Data Analytics Certificate, which provided me with a solid foundation in the fundamentals of data analysis. I also recently completed a Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Data Management, which deepened my understanding of advanced techniques and tools for data analysis, as well as data visualization, machine learning, and statistical modeling.
