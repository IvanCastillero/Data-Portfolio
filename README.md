# Data Science and Analytics proyects

Hi, I'm Ivan. I'm a data scientist with a background in psychology. My journey started at Universidad Católica Santa María la Antigua (USMA), where my interest in psychology evolved into a fascination with data science.

Since 2022, I've been diving into data analytics, picking up key skills and knowledge. I've completed courses like the Google Data Analytics Certificate and furthered my education with a Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Data Management from the University of Texas. I've also tackled MIT's Data Science and Machine Learning program to understand how to make data-driven decisions.

My experience includes a year as a Business Development Specialist Intern at GBM, an IBM associated company. There, I combined my psychology insights with data analytics to contribute to business strategies.

In this portfolio, you'll see a range of projects where I've applied my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. Each project is a piece of my journey in blending psychology with data science.

I'm open to collaborations and opportunities that let me put these skills to good use. Take a look around, and feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or just want to chat about data science.

## [Proyect 1: FoofHub](https://github.com/IvanCastillero/FoodHub-EDA-python-proyect)
This project involves analyzing a dataset related to food delivery orders from various restaurants. The dataset contains information about the order, customer, restaurant, cuisine, cost, day of the week, rating, food preparation time, and delivery time. The aim of the project is to gain insights into customer behavior, restaurant operations, and satisfaction ratings. The analysis involves exploring the relationship between various variables, identifying trends, and making recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and optimize restaurant operations.

## [Proyect 2: Diabetes prediction model](https://github.com/IvanCastillero/Diabetes-prediction-model-Python)
This project aimed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on several clinical variables. The dataset used in this project contained information on 768 patients and their diabetes status. I clean the data, created a logistic regression model for the dataset, tested the performance of the model, and drew conclusions in the end.
