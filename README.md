# Data Science and Analytics proyects

Hello, my name is Ivan and I am a junior data analyst. I have always been fascinated by the power of data to inform decision-making, drive innovation, and solve complex problems. Over the past few years, I have pursued my passion for data analytics by completing several courses, including the Google Data Analytics Certificate, which provided me with a solid foundation in the fundamentals of data analysis. I also recently completed a Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Data Management, which deepened my understanding of advanced techniques and tools for data analysis, as well as data visualization, machine learning, and statistical modeling. With these skills, I am excited to apply my knowledge and contribute to data-driven solutions that make a meaningful impact. Through this portfolio, you will see how I implement the skills IÂ´ve developed as a Data Analyst.

The dataset contains information about the order, customer, restaurant, cuisine, cost, day of the week, rating, food preparation time, and delivery time. The aim of the project is to gain insights into customer behavior, restaurant operations, and satisfaction ratings. The analysis involves exploring the relationship between various variables, identifying trends, and making recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and optimize restaurant operations.
