# Data Science and Analytics proyects

Hi, my name is Ivan. I'm a psychologist AND a data scientist. I like to show information in a very undestandable and concise way, so below you will find bulletpoints with the most important points about myself as a professional and about this e-portfolio.

# Preparation
- I graduated as a psychologist from Universidad Católica Santa María la Antigua (USMA) in Panama in late 2023.

- I started my data science jounrey since 2022. I've completed courser, specializations, and post-graduate programs such as:
  - Google Data Analytics Certificate and Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science.
  - Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Data Management from the University of Texas.
  - MIT's Data Science and Machine Learning program.
  - As well as several AWS services focused on Data Analytics.
 
  - I have worked data science and analytics projects using tools like: Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Tableau, Power BI, AWS Quicksight   

# Professional experience
- My most relevant professional experience includes a year as a Business Development Specialist Intern at GBM, an IBM associated company. Where I combined my Psychology knowledge with Data Analytics to contribute to business strategies across several innovation projects aimed at solving real world and long-lasting problems.

- I have also been a volunteer or intern in many social initiatives, programs and organizations in Panama, such as NGOs, government institutions, banks, HR consulting companies, among others.

# About this portfolio
- This portfolio showcases a range of projects where I've applied my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. Most of them are academic projects since those developed in professional enviornment are protected by intelectual propoerty or w but they still are a very good representation . 

I'm open to collaborations and opportunities that let me put these skills to good use. Take a look around, and feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together.

## [Proyect 1: FoodHub](https://github.com/IvanCastillero/FoodHub-EDA-python-proyect)
This project involves analyzing a dataset related to food delivery orders from various restaurants. The dataset contains information about the order, customer, restaurant, cuisine, cost, day of the week, rating, food preparation time, and delivery time. The aim of the project is to gain insights into customer behavior, restaurant operations, and satisfaction ratings. The analysis involves exploring the relationship between various variables, identifying trends, and making recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and optimize restaurant operations.

## [Proyect 2: Diabetes prediction model](https://github.com/IvanCastillero/Diabetes-prediction-model-Python)
This project aimed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on several clinical variables. The dataset used in this project contained information on 768 patients and their diabetes status. I clean the data, created a logistic regression model for the dataset, tested the performance of the model, and drew conclusions in the end.
